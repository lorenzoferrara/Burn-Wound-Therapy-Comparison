In order to prevent and manage infection in burn patients, various treatment methods have been developed.
Two commonly used methods are bathing care and body cleansing. Bathing care involves the daily cleaning
of the burn wound with a mild soap and water, followed by the application of a topical antimicrobial agent.
Body cleansing, on the other hand, involves the use of an antiseptic solution, such as chlorhexidine, to
cleanse the wound. Both methods aim to reduce bacterial colonization and prevent infection. However, the
effectiveness of these treatments may vary depending on the type and severity of the burn, as well as the
specific bacteria present in the wound.
This report aims to compare the effectiveness of bathing care and body cleansing in the management of burn
wounds, using a dataset of 154 patients who have been treated with one of these methods.
